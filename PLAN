Milestone 1 (red-hens beta 0.02):
----------------------------------
v gtk_init fix (Ken) [May 1, 2000]
v Signals
  v What to do about duplicate signals (especially "activate" on menu
    items is missing). [Fixed (Henning, May 31, 2000). Such signals,
    that previously clashed, have their widget name as part of the
    SML connection function name.]

  v bitmaps / drawables [Fixed: Henning, June 14, 2000]
v Incoporate Mike's Win32 port [Fixed: Henning, June 5, 2000]
v Fix  mgtk_callback_destroy
v Fix GC bugs.
  v I think there is one in mgtk_callback_dispatch [Fixed: Ken, June
    6, 2000.  I don't think there are any GC bugs in header.c now]
