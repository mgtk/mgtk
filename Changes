Changes since mgtk-alpha-0.01

* Added a Win32 port (thanks to Mike Thomas!).

* Added a bunch of widgets and functions from the Sugar gtk.defs file.

* Added some signals that previously clashed with other, ``more 
  important'', ones. Such a signal has as it's SML connect function
  the name ``connect_<widget name>_<signal name>''.

* Added some new examples

* Fixed some bugs. For example,
  + command line arguments are now passed on to gtk_init.
  + short version of functions with no arguments are now also in the
    signature.
  + bugs related to Garbage Collection and (minor) space leaks.
  + more than one flag can now be given to functions expecting flags.
