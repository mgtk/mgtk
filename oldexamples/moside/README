If you want to play with the mosIDE example you also have to set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.  If you are in the moside dir this can be
done by the command:
	    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Note this is *not* intended as a real application, it is just a small
demo program.  Since this uses the Unix module, you may have problems
trying it out under Windows.

The Unix module was written by Peter Sestoft and will be part of
Moscow ML version 2.00.


Enjoy!
