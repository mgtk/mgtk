	* Translate.sml: Use the new signal infrastructure 

2001-03-22  Ken Friis Larsen  <kfl@it.edu>

	* Translate.sml: Removed the XXX_val_nocast macro
	definition.

2000-07-21  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* ParseUtils.sml, TypeInfo.sml: consolidated functions for modules
	stuff.

2000-07-19  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* State.sml: made a more general and hopefully more intelligent
	options-handling structure.
 	
	* Target.sml, Messages.sml, Main.sml: using this structure.
	
2000-07-12  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Many files: Added/updated documentation in signature files, and
	in the process cleaned-up some of the code (mostly removing
	functionality not needed elsewhere).

2000-07-12  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml: Cleaned up the mess about where the TypeInfo name
	functions are applied. 

	* NameUtil.sml: Made all name functions produce wseq's instead of
	strings.
 
2000-07-11  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Changed name from mgtkgen to defs2sml.

2000-07-10  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): phew! Finished the restructuring
	necessitated by the restructuring of type names. This turned out
	to be quite an extensive reworking of many things. Luckily, this
	actually simplified a large part of mgtkgen.

	Here are more details:
	+ All type names (and most ordinary names) now consist of a path
	part and a base part. Functions for converting such `names' to
	strings representing C and ML functions are in TypeInfo.
	Unfortunately, I had to make a number of ad-hoc converters in
	TypeInfo in order not to break too many things---this will
	hopefully improve. (In the process I also stumbled over
	documentation on Gtk+ name splitting, and made the code more
	correct in this respect.)
	+ Many namings became more consistent and there is now only one
	place to change them (TypeInfo). Also the code is now divided more
	clearly into phases.
	+ A lot of the code is now easier to understand (I hope).
	
	Still left todo:
	+ Apply more clean-up. Some things seems a little in-consistent
	right now. (At the very least check signals and when the TypeInfo
	name functions are applied in Translate.) There is also some
	tension between using strings and using wseq's.
	+ Add and rewrite documentation.
	+ Specify precisely the more ad-hoc notions in TypeInfo.
	+ Actually write the code to make multiple modules; that was the
	big idea in the first place.

2000-07-03  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Parser.sml and ParseUtils.{sig,sml}: separated the construction
	of abstract syntax into separate files.

2000-06-25  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* TypExp.sml: moved the long-part of types to the right place; now
	it is located with the type names.

2000-06-19  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Parser.sml: Changed to the parser combinators provided by
	mosml. This eliminated the lexer, the parser combinators from
	Fritz, and the lazy streams from Fritz.

2000-06-19  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml and TypeExp.sml: Now using convenience bindings
	for long names:
	    structure A  = AST
	    structure U  = Util
	    structure TE = TypeExp
	    structure TI = TypeInfo
	    structure NU = NameUtil
        I have been wanting to do this for quite a while, but mosml
	wouldn't let me :-)
	
2000-06-18  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Moved the construction of function types
	from many places in Translate.sml to the construction of
	FUNCTION_DECL in AST.sml. A TypeExp.ARROW now contains the
	parameters and output parameters (the two first arguments), the
	complete list of parameters, and the result type.

2000-06-14  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Added the possibility for boxed types to
	have an inheritance hierarchy associated with it (only on the
	types level). This is modeled after the stuff we do for widgets.
	
2000-06-13  Ken Friis Larsen  <kfl@it.edu>

	* Translate.sml: Fixed a small bug: the keyword eqtype is not
	allowed in declarations	(.sml files) only in specs (.sig files).

2000-06-13  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Made flags ``real'' flags. Functions with
	a flag argument expects a list of flags; functions returning a
	flag returns a list of flags. All flags and enums have been made
	eqtypes.
	
2000-06-11  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Made the handling of types more
	modular. Now all ``major'' types have their own constructor, and
	most type related stuff are delegated to TypeExp or TypeInfo.

2000-06-11  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* ChangeLog: I have forgotten to update the ChangeLog in a
	while. I will be more careful.
	
2000-05-09  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Prepared for the split into Gdk and Gtk:
	added a new ``long type'' with a path describing the modules of
	the real type.

2000-05-02  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Combinators.sig: Added two functions skip and skipN
	skipping tokens until a predicate is satified.

	* Combinators.sml: ditto.

	* Parser.sml: Added skip-to-next-declaration in case of
	a syntax error.

	* Translate.sml: Allowed for boxed types with no ref/unref
	functions.

2000-04-10  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml: Now boxed types are all defined to be
	of type gpointer internally in the SML structure.

2000-04-07  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml: Fixed a bug concerning output types.

	* Parse.sml: Minor update to return the position of a syntax
	error.

	* Lexer.sig, Lexer.sml: ditto.

2000-04-03  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Util.sml: Added documentation.

	* (all files): added copyright message.

2000-03-28  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml: Fixed bug with short functions: some functions
	weren't declared in the SML files (frame_new, for example), and
	they had the wrong ``primitive'' type and a wrong argument list in
	the C file.

	* NameUtil.sml: Improved naming hack.

2000-03-27  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Main.sml: added no-footer option.

2000-03-20  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Combinators.sig: Added documentation of interface.

	* AST.sml (new file AST.sig): ditto.

	* Parse.sml: ditto.

	* WSeq.sig: ditto.

	* Lexer.sig: ditto.

	* ArgParse.sig: ditto.

	* Messages.sig: ditto.

	* Stream.sig: ditto.

	* NameUtil.sml (new file NameUtil.sig): Added documentation.

	* Regression/: Added regression tests.
	
	* Makefile: ditto.
