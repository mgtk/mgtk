	* Translate.sml (et al): Moved the construction of function types
	from many places in Translate.sml to the construction of
	FUNCTION_DECL in AST.sml. A TypeExp.ARROW now contains the
	parameters and output parameters (the two first arguments), the
	complete list of parameters, and the result type.

2000-06-14  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Added the possibility for boxed types to
	have an inheritance hierarchy associated with it (only on the
	types level). This is modeled after the stuff we do for widgets.
	
2000-06-13  Ken Friis Larsen  <kfl@it.edu>

	* Translate.sml: Fixed a small bug: the keyword eqtype is not
	allowed in declarations	(.sml files) only in specs (.sig files).

2000-06-13  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Made flags ``real'' flags. Functions with
	a flag argument expects a list of flags; functions returning a
	flag returns a list of flags. All flags and enums have been made
	eqtypes.
	
2000-06-11  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Made the handling of types more
	modular. Now all ``major'' types have their own constructor, and
	most type related stuff are delegated to TypeExp or TypeInfo.

	* ChangeLog: I have forgotten to update the ChangeLog in a
	while. I will be more careful.
	
2000-05-09  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml (et al): Prepared for the split into Gdk and Gtk:
	added a new ``long type'' with a path describing the modules of
	the real type.

2000-05-02  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Combinators.sig: Added two functions skip and skipN
	skipping tokens until a predicate is satified.

	* Combinators.sml: ditto.

	* Parser.sml: Added skip-to-next-declaration in case of
	a syntax error.

	* Translate.sml: Allowed for boxed types with no ref/unref
	functions.

2000-04-10  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml: Now boxed types are all defined to be
	of type gpointer internally in the SML structure.

2000-04-07  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml: Fixed a bug concerning output types.

	* Parse.sml: Minor update to return the position of a syntax
	error.

	* Lexer.sig, Lexer.sml: ditto.

2000-04-03  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Util.sml: Added documentation.

	* (all files): added copyright message.

2000-03-28  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Translate.sml: Fixed bug with short functions: some functions
	weren't declared in the SML files (frame_new, for example), and
	they had the wrong ``primitive'' type and a wrong argument list in
	the C file.

	* NameUtil.sml: Improved naming hack.

2000-03-27  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Main.sml: added no-footer option.

2000-03-20  Henning Niss  <hniss@diku.dk>

	* Combinators.sig: Added documentation of interface.

	* AST.sml (new file AST.sig): ditto.

	* Parse.sml: ditto.

	* WSeq.sig: ditto.

	* Lexer.sig: ditto.

	* ArgParse.sig: ditto.

	* Messages.sig: ditto.

	* Stream.sig: ditto.

	* NameUtil.sml (new file NameUtil.sig): Added documentation.

	* Regression/: Added regression tests.
	
	* Makefile: ditto.
