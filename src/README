BUILDING MGTK

Building mGtk is a two phase process. First mgtkgen --- the program
that generates the source code from a specification file --- has to be
built, and then the files constituting the API can be built.

Let ${MGTKHOME} be the directory in which you unpacked mGtk.

(1) Configure everything by changing ${MGTKHOME}/src/Makefile.inc to
    match your setup.

(2) Building mgtkgen

    (a) cd ${MGTKHOME}/src/mgtkgen

    (b) make

   [(c) make test  (to check that everything went well)]

(3) Building mGtk

    (a) cd ${MGTKHOME}/src

    (b) make

You can now try some of the examples in the ${MGTKHOME}/examples
directory.
