============ Version 0.93 (the "Add as many functions as possible"-release)

2004-07-12  Henning Niss <hniss@itu.dk>
	* Handled the "wrong make"-problem now allowing classes to return
	objects of other class types.
	* Special-cased some weird name problems.
	* Included a bunch of functions that were previously excluded for
	various reasons.
	* Added support for defaults for parameters (functions with defaults
	specified in the .defs file now takes 'a option's as parameters).
	* Now "pretty printing" the generated SML code (though it still is
	not as pretty as it could be, but it has the potential :-))
	* Flags (as specified in the gtk.defs file is now supported - use of
	list of the flag you wish to turn on)
