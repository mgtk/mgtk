   valuta.sml (a port of a Peter Sestoft Java example)
   twowindows.sml (how to have more than one window)
   fileview.sml	(a very simple file viewer, uses the text widget)
   fileedit.sml (an extremely simple file editor, uses a ScrolledWindow)
   fileedit2.sml (a very simple file editor, better layout than fileedit)
   counter.sml (a first attempt to move some of the event loop to SML,
                uses the FunInput stuff.)
