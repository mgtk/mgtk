DOCUMENTATION

The documentation for mGTK is currently very sparse (read: non-
existent). The definitive resource is of course the Gtk.sig file.
That file details the types of all functions in mGTK. Unfortunately,
the code isn't all that readable; we hope you'll manage.

The mGTK toolkit uses a naming scheme based on the original GTK+
toolkit. Therefore a lot of information about the usage can be found
by consulting the documentation for GTK+. One should just remember
that the prefix ``gtk_'' has been dropped in mGTK. When reading GTK+
examples simply remember that optional parameters have SML type 
... option, and that convenience functions exists without all optional
parameters.

The GTK+ documentation can be found here:

    http://www.gtk.org/rdp/      (the GTK+ Reference Document Project)
    http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/                   (the GTK+ Tutorial)
