* Come up with better CONTRIB items :-)

* Help us answer the questions
   (1) ``Manual'' or ``automatic'' initialization (should Gtk.init
       be called explicitly, or is it better that the library takes
       care of the initialization)?
   
   (2) Names for functions with optional parameters.  At the moment there
       are two versions of functions that takes optional parameters:
       one with the normal gtk+ name, for example:
      
   	val text_new: 'a GtkAdjustment option -> 'b GtkAdjustment option
                                                 -> base GtkText
   
       and one with the normal name and a pling, for example:
   
           val text_new': unit -> base GtkText
      
       The plinged version corresponds to the normal version called with
       all optional arguments set to NONE.
    
       Should this be the other way around?  That is, should the version
       with the optional arguments be called name_full, and the shorter
       (default?) version be called name?
   
   (3) Should the functions that may fail return an option or should they
       raise an exception.

* Use mGTK to build a real application.

* Make a systematic testing, maybe by porting the testgtk suite.

* Write documentation, especially a tutorial would be nice.
