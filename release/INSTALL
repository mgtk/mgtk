BUILDING MGTK

Building mGTK should be easy.

Let ${MGTKHOME} be the directory in which you unpacked mGtk.

(1) Configure everything by changing ${MGTKHOME}/Makefile.inc to
    match your setup.

(2) Building mGTK

    (a) make

You can now try some of the examples in the ${MGTKHOME}/examples
directory.  Remember the read the README file there
