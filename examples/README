TRYING THE EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

This directory contains a few example programs to get you started with
mGTK.  In order to try the example programs, issue the following
commands

(1) Build mgtk as described in ../src/README

(2) make

(3) export MGTKHOME=../src  (when using bash)
    setenv MGTKHOME ../src  (when using [t]csh)

(4) mosml -I ../src

(5) load "<file>";  (where <file> is the name of the file
                     *without* the .uo extension)

(6) <file>.main();


Here is a list of the programs:
