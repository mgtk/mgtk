TRYING THE EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

This directory contains a few example programs to get you started with
mGtk.  In order to try the example programs, issue the following
commands

(1) make

(2) export MGTKHOME=../src  (when using bash)
    setenv MGTKHOME ../src  (when using [t]csh)

(3) mosml -I ../src

(4) load "<file>";  (where <file> is the name of the file
                     *without* the .uo extension)

(5) <file>.main();
