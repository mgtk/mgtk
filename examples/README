TRYING THE EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

This directory contains a few example programs to get you started with
mGTK.  In order to try the example programs, issue the following
commands

(1) Build mGTK as described in ../INSTALL

(2) make (Unix) or nmake /f Makefile.w32 (Windows with MSVC)

(3) set an environment variable:
    Unix:
      export MGTKHOME=~/mgtk-beta  (when using bash)
      setenv MGTKHOME ~/mgtk-beta  (when using [t]csh)

    Windows:
      set MGTKHOME=\mgtk-beta

(4) mosml -I ~/mgtk-beta

(5) load "<file>";  (where <file> is the name of the file
                     *without* the .uo extension)

(6) <file>.main();


Here is a list of the programs:
