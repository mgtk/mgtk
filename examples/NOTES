listview.sml
------------
An example adopted from "Mono, A Developers Notebook"
(04-gtk/07-listview).  Shows how to use TreeView as a grid-like
widget.

Defects:
  - The program does not compile.
  - We need to handle GtkTreeIter, in particullar as the return
    (actually out-param) for append. 
  - To use a ListStore we need two varargs functions:
       - new (or the language binding-friendly version newv)
         For this we also need to wrap GType somehow
       - set (or set_valist)
    Workaround for varargs: use other functions newv and set_value        


menus.sml
---------
An example adopted from "Mono, A Developers Notebook"
(04-gtk/06-menus).  Shows how to build menus and uses stock icons.

Defects:
  - Custom accelerators are not possible because Gdk support is
    missing.


signup.sml
----------
An example adopted from "Mono: A Developers Notebook"
(04-gtk/03-signup).  Shows how to use mnemonic labels and XML markup.

Defects:
  - Glib interfaces don't work.  Thus, Gtk.Entry does not have a
    "changed" signal because we cannot use the one from Gtk.Editable.
    A workaround was using Gtk.Signal directly was possible.

  - Glib properties does not work.  Thus, it is not possible to set
    the "xalign" property of a label.  Workaround: use
    Misc.set_alignment.
  
  - Using functions with default arguments is cumbersome.
