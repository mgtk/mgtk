dragdrop.sml
------------
An example adopted from "Mono, A Developers Notebook"
(04-gtk/08-dragdrop).  Shows how to implement drag & drop.

Defects:
  - The program does not compile due to missing Gdk.Pixbuf support,
    and perhaps also missing GError -> exceptions stuff.
    WORKAROUND: Use high-level Gtk.Image API instead.
  - The program does not compile due to missing Gtk.TargetEntry
    support: no way to create one (assumed nice default).
  - The program does not compile due to missing Gtk.TargetList
    support: no structure in Gtk, no list-array support(?) for new. 
  - Missing function gtk_drag_dest_set.  Assumes that it will be in
    Gtk.Widget (like drag_dest_unset). An alternative could be to make
    a structure Gtk.Drag.
  - Missing enum types GtkDestDefaults, GdkDragAction, GdkModifierType
  - Missing function gtk_drag_source_set.  Assumes that it will be in
    Gtk.Widget.
  - Missing gtk_drag_set_icon_pixbuf. Assumes that it will be in
    Gtk.Widget.
  - Missing gtk_drag_set_icon_pixbuf. Assumes that it will be in
    Gtk.Widget.
  - Missing support for types GdkDragContext and GtkSelectionData.  I
    think that Gtk.SelectionData is just a (too) general encoding of a
    string.
  - In the function dataGet the argument data, is really an out-param,
    which is supposed to fill.  Currently this is done by fictious
    function set.


treeview.sml
------------
An example adopted from "Mono, A Developers Notebook"
(04-gtk/07-treeview).  Shows how to use TreeView as a tree-view
widget.

Defects:
  - The program does not compile.
  - We need to handle GtkTreeIter, in particullar as the return
    (actually out-param) for append. 


listview.sml
------------
An example adopted from "Mono, A Developers Notebook"
(04-gtk/07-listview).  Shows how to use TreeView as a grid-like
widget.

Defects:
  - The program does not compile.
  - We need to handle GtkTreeIter, in particullar as the return
    (actually out-param) for append. 


menus.sml
---------
An example adopted from "Mono, A Developers Notebook"
(04-gtk/06-menus).  Shows how to build menus and uses stock icons.

Defects:
  - Custom accelerators are not possible because Gdk support is
    missing.


signup.sml
----------
An example adopted from "Mono: A Developers Notebook"
(04-gtk/03-signup).  Shows how to use mnemonic labels and XML markup.

Defects:
  - Glib properties does not work.  Thus, it is not possible to set
    the "xalign" property of a label.  Workaround: use
    Misc.set_alignment.
  
  - Using functions with default arguments is cumbersome.



OLD DEFECTS:

listview.sml  (2004/09/28)
--------------------------

  - To use a ListStore we need two varargs functions:
       - new (or the language binding-friendly version newv)
         For this we also need to wrap GType somehow
       - set (or set_valist)
    Workaround for varargs: use other functions newv and set_value        
  - The same as those for listview.sml

  => GType and GValue now wrapped (at least superficially)
  => Array support added to handle newv


signup.sml  (2004/09/27)
------------------------

  - Glib interfaces don't work.  Thus, Gtk.Entry does not have a
    "changed" signal because we cannot use the one from Gtk.Editable.
    A workaround was using Gtk.Signal directly was possible.

  => Now Entry (similaryly for all other implementations of
     interfaces) includes an asEditable function.
