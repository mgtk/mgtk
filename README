CURRENT VERSION
---------------
The current version is 
    red-hens (or mgtk-beta-0.02)

Previous versions include
    green-horses-and-blue-ducks (or mgtk-alpha-0.01)


ABOUT
-----

mGTK is an SML interface to the C-based graphical toolkit Gtk+ (the
Gimp Toolkit).  Gtk+ is available from the homepage:
	http://www.gtk.org

We use Moscow ML's foreign function interface to call the C functions
in Gtk+.  Therefore, mGTK can only be used with Moscow ML (version
1.44 or newer).  However, we are very interested if somebody wants to
port mGTK to other SML systems and are willing to provide information
and help.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

mGTK should work on any platform supported by both Moscow ML and
Gtk+. We develop and test mGTK on Linux machines (running RedHat).
mGTK is known to run successfully on the following machines

*   Linux, X86, RedHat 6.1/6.2
*   Windows, X86


If you have had any success running mGTK on some other platform,
please send us an email with a description of the machine.

The following versions of Moscow ML and Gtk+ are required:

Moscow ML: Version 1.44 (or newer) compiled with dynlib support.  
       Moscow ML is available from:
	      http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html

Gtk+: mGTK will only work with the 1.2.x series.  Check your Gtk+ 
      version with the command:
              gtk-config --version
      Gtk+ is available from:
              http://www.gtk.org/
              http://www.gimp.org/win32 (Windows version)


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

At this time there is no documentation for mGTK :-(
However, it should be possible to use the documentation for the C
interface to Gtk+ (available at the Gtk+ homepage; see above).

Also, you can take a peek in the examples directory (remember to read
the README file there).
