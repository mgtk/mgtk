REQUIREMENTS
------------

mGTK should work on any platform supported by both Moscow ML or MLton, and
Gtk+. We develop and test mGTK on Linux machines (running RedHat).
mGTK is known to run successfully on the following machines

*   Linux, X86, Debian Sarge
*   Windows, X86 (not in this pre-release)


If you have had any success running mGTK on some other platform,
please send us an email with a description of the machine.

The following versions of Moscow ML or MLton, and Gtk+ are required:

Moscow ML: Version 2.00 (or newer) compiled with dynlib support.  
       Moscow ML is available from:
	      http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html
or
MLton: Tested with version 20040227 and 20041109 from Debian.
       MLton is available from:
              http://mlton.org


and 
Gtk+: mGTK will only work with the 2.4.x series.  Check your Gtk+ 
      version with the command:
               pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0
      Gtk+ is available from:
              http://www.gtk.org/
              http://www.gimp.org/win32 (Windows version)


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

At this time there is no documentation for mGTK :-(
However, it should be possible to use the documentation for the C
interface to Gtk+ (available at the Gtk+ homepage; see above).

Also, you can take a peek in the examples directory (remember to read
the README file there).
