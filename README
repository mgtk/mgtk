CURRENT VERSION
---------------
The current version is 
    green-horses-and-blue-ducks (or mgtk-alpha-0.01)



ABOUT
-----

mGTK is a SML interface to the graphical toolkit gtk+ written in C. The gtk+ 
toolkit is available from the homepage:
	http://www.gtk.org

We use Moscow ML's foreign function interface to call the C functions
in gtk+.  Therefore, mGTK can only be used with Moscow ML (version
1.44 or newer).  However, we are very interested if somebody wants to
port mGTK to other SML systems and are willing to provide information
and help.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Moscow ML: Version 1.44 (or newer) compiled with dynlib support.  
       Moscow ML is available from:
	      http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html

gtk+: mGTK will only work with 1.2.x series.  Check you gtk version
      with the command:
		gtk-config --version


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

At this time there is no documentation for mGTK :-(
But it should be possible to use the documentation for the C interface
to gtk+ available the gtk+ homepage

Also, you can take a peek in the examples directory (Remember to read
the README file there).
